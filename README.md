# 🕳️ Chamber

**Chamber** is a small, private communication tool for two people.  
No accounts. No storage. No logs. Just a quiet space to talk, then disappear.

## 💬 What It Does

Chamber lets you create a temporary room where only two people can chat.  
Once the chat ends or time runs out, everything is gone — no history, no data left behind.

- No registration  
- No databases  
- No cookies or analytics  
- Works instantly in your browser  
- You can even run it on your own computer or through Tor for extra privacy

## ⚡ How to Use It

1. Open **Chamber** in your browser.  
2. Click **Create Room.** (only one user creates it)
3. Choose your TTL **Time to leave** then create room
4. You’ll get a **Room ID** and **two access codes.**  
   - One code is for you.  
   - The other is for the person you want to talk to.  
5. Share your partner’s code **safely** (phone call, encrypted message, face-to-face).  
6. You both enter the same **Room ID** with your own codes.
7. You both enter **Identical passphrase** and enter the room
8. When either person leaves, the chat disappears forever.

> **It’s not the most convenient — but it does one function, done right.**

## 🔐 Safety Tips

- Treat access codes like keys — share them only with the right person.  
- Avoid posting codes in public or cloud chats.  
- Keep your device secure; privacy starts with your hardware.  
- Use Tor or a VPN if you need extra anonymity.  
- When in doubt, just close the tab — Chamber forgets everything.

## 🧠 Mission Statement

Chamber is a simple statement — a reminder that freedom doesn’t need permission.  
It’s built for independence, not for control.
